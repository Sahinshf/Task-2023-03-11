          Yes! Our challenges provide professional designs but there are no
          rules on what tools to use. So feel free to use anything you like to
          build your projects.

          The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our Slack
          community. There are thousands of other developers in there, so it's a
          great place to ask questions. We even have a dedicated "help" channel!
          If you haven't joined yet, you can get an invite to our Slack
          community here.

          Definitely! Please do feel free to use whatever you build in your
          portfolio. Helping developers add professional-looking projects to

          We don't provide "official" solutions for the challenges. This is
          because there is no single perfect way to complete a challenge.
          Instead, you're encouraged to review other people's code in the
          community. You can learn so much by seeing how other people have
          approached the same challenges and giving them feedback.

          Frontend Mentor is a collaborative learning community where everyone
          can give feedback to each other. If you'd like to receive feedback
          from the community, please be sure to post a question when you submit
          your solution. The more specific you can be, the better. Being clear
          with your questions means you're much more likely to receive valuable
          feedback from others.
